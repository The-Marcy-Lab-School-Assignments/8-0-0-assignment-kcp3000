# Question

The endpoint `/api/data` is handled by the controller `serveData` below.

If I send a request to `/api/data?filter=frog`, how do I get the value of the query parameter `filter`?

```js
const serveData = (req, res, next) => {
  const filterValue = ???
  // use the filterValue and send back a response
}
app.get('/api/data', serveData);
```

# Answer

You would do `req.query.filter` and equate that to the filterValue variable, then use `.send` (this part is optional, only if you want the user to see what's being sent)

# Teacher Feedback

Yup! In the future be a bit more clear on what you mean, it is not optional to send a response however it is optional to send back this specific query as a response.
